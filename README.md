🌸 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset


📘 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, one of the most famous datasets in data science.
The main goal of this analysis is to understand the structure of the dataset, visualize relationships between variables, and identify patterns that can help in further model building.

🧠 Objectives

To explore and clean the Iris dataset.

To understand relationships between sepal and petal measurements.

To visualize the dataset using various plots.

To identify patterns among different Iris species.

🧾 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

Each sample has the following features:

Feature	Description
SepalLengthCm	Length of the sepal in centimeters
SepalWidthCm	Width of the sepal in centimeters
PetalLengthCm	Length of the petal in centimeters
PetalWidthCm	Width of the petal in centimeters
Species	Type of Iris flower
🧰 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical computation

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Advanced visualization

📊 Key Steps in Analysis

Importing libraries and dataset

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Descriptive Statistics

Univariate and Bivariate Analysis

Visualization using pair plots, histograms, and boxplots

Conclusions drawn from data insights

📈 Visualizations Included

Pairplot to compare features

Histogram for distribution analysis

📚 Results & Insights

Iris Setosa shows distinct petal and sepal dimensions compared to other species.

Petal length and width are strong indicators for classifying Iris species.

The dataset is clean and ready for machine learning model training.

🧩 Conclusion

The EDA on Iris Dataset provides clear insights into the structure and relationships among features.
It establishes a strong foundation for applying classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees in future steps.
